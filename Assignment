Indicator 1: Moving Average (MA)

Explanation: A moving average smooths out price fluctuations by taking the average price over a chosen period. It helps visualize the underlying trend and identify potential support and resistance levels.
Pine Script Code:
Pine Script
//@version=5
indicator("Moving Average", overlay=true)
length = input(20, title="Length") // Change this value to adjust the averaging period
ma = sma(close, length) // Calculate the Simple Moving Average of closing prices
plot(ma, color=color.blue, linewidth=2, title="Moving Average")
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

input(20, title="Length") defines a user-friendly input where you can specify the number of periods used for the average (default 20).
ma = sma(close, length) calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA) using the close price and the chosen length.
plot(ma, color=color.blue, linewidth=2, title="Moving Average") plots the calculated moving average as a blue line with a thickness of 2 pixels and a title "Moving Average".
Indicator 2: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Explanation: RSI measures the momentum of price changes by comparing the average of recent gains to the average of recent losses. It helps identify potential overbought or oversold conditions.
Pine Script Code:
Pine Script
//@version=5
indicator("RSI", overlay=true)
length = input(14, title="Length") // Change this value to adjust the averaging period
up = rsi(change(close), length, true)
down = rsi(change(close), length, false)
rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + up / down))
plot(rsi, color=color.orange, linewidth=2, title="RSI")
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

Similar to MA, input(14, title="Length") allows you to adjust the averaging period (default 14).
up = rsi(change(close), length, true) calculates the average of recent gains using the RSI function with true for calculating gains.
down = rsi(change(close), length, false) calculates the average of recent losses using RSI with false for calculating losses.
The final rsi calculation transforms the values into a 0-100 scale, with higher values indicating potentially overbought conditions and lower values potentially oversold.
plot(rsi, color=color.orange, linewidth=2, title="RSI") plots the RSI as an orange line with a thickness of 2 pixels and a title "RSI".
Remember: These are just basic examples. You can customize the code further by adding alerts, changing plot styles, or incorporating other indicators for a more comprehensive analysis. However, it's crucial to understand that technical indicators should be used in conjunction with other factors and not considered foolproof trading signals.
