Indicator 1: Moving Average (MA)

 A moving average smooths out price fluctuations by taking the average price over a chosen period. It helps visualize the underlying trend and identify potential support and resistance levels.
Pine Script Code:
indicator("Moving Average", overlay=true)
length = input(20, title="Length") // Change this value to adjust the averaging period
ma = sma(close, length) // Calculate the Simple Moving Average of closing prices
plot(ma, color=color.blue, linewidth=2, title="Moving Average")

Indicator 2: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures the momentum of price changes by comparing the average of recent gains to the average of recent losses. It helps identify potential overbought or oversold conditions.
Pine Script Code:
indicator("RSI", overlay=true)
length = input(14, title="Length") // Change this value to adjust the averaging period
up = rsi(change(close), length, true)
down = rsi(change(close), length, false)
rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + up / down))
plot(rsi, color=color.orange, linewidth=2, title="RSI")
